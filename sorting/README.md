### Points to Ponder

- Bubble sort is Extremely Inefficient! So much so that it couldn't even complete execution on a large data set in significant time
- Selection Sort, like Bubble Sort, is dead slow when it comes to large data set (of the order of million)
- Merge Sort, on my machine, was quick enough to churn a million data items in around 7-8 seconds 

### To-Do
1. Real time version of Insertion Sort: it might or might not improve the algorithm in general. Either way, it is something worth experimenting
