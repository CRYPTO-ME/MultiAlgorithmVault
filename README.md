## Multilingual Algorithm Vault
As the name suggests, this repository is a consolidated analysis of various data structures and algorithms.

### Purpose
- manifestation of Algorithms in real life to distinguish them, their functioning and performance
- highlight the contrast between different programming languages
- observe code evolve. That is, beautify, simplify and shrinkify
- act as a one stop reference

### Programming Languages
1. C/C++
2. Python
3. JavaScript (with a front-end)
4. Java

### Sorting Algorithms
1. Selection Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Radix Sort (using counting sort)

### Searching Algoriths
1. Binary Search
2. Linear Search


### Contribution
It is natural that a single person can not know all the tricks that different languages have to offer. Therefore, this repository encourages the ones interested to make contributions whatsoever. However, plagiarism is not appreciated as it dishonors the very purpose of learning.

#### Keep in mind the following General Outline:-
1. Modularity: Seperate, Standalone and importable- Each algorithm must be coded keeping in mind that it has following two purposes
    - First, it has to race against other algorithms on a mutual data set in a mutual file (performanceMeasurement)
    - Second, it can actually be used as a fully fledged mechanism on a user-defined data set
2. Make sure you pay attention to detail. Document anything and everything that seems to be remotely fascinating to you!
