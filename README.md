## Multilingual Algorithm Vault
As the name suggests, this repository is a consolidated analysis of various data structures and algorithms.

### Programming Languages
1. C/C++
2. Python
3. JavaScript (with a front-end)
4. Java

### Sorting Algorithms
1. Selection Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Radix Sort (using counting sort)

### Searching Algoriths
1. Binary Search
2. Linear Search

### Purpose
- manifestation of Algorithms in real life to distinguish 'em and their functioning
- act as a one stop reference
- a purpose to learn and observe

### Points to Ponder
1. LinearSearch is benefited when data items are unsorted (i.e. in this case, left as is in the order of their (pseudo)random generation)
