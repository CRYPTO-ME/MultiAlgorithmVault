## Multilingual Algorithm Vault
As the name suggests, this repository is a consolidated analysis of various data structures and algorithms.

### Purpose
- manifestation of Algorithms in real life to distinguish them, their functioning and performance
- highlight the contrast between different programming languages
- act as a one stop reference! This repository has source code of various algorithms as well as **ready-made libraries** for the below listed languages

### Programming Languages
- C/C++
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript (with a front-end)

### Usage
First things first, grab a copy of this repository for your local machine!
1. Navigate to your working directory
   `cd /path/to/desired/directory`
2. Clone the repo. It'll be saved inside the directory you navigated to in above step
   `git clone https://github.com/ankitrai96/multilingual-algorithm-vault.git`
   ###### Note: If you do not have git installed in your computer then [click here](https://github.com/ankitrai96/multilingual-algorithm-vault/archive/master.zip)

Now, in addition to being hackable this repository offers the following out of the box features:-

- **Library** which make various algorithms importable for you to use directly in your projects. To know more, navigate to "importables" directory
- **Performance Analysis** to see how different algorithms' asymptotic runtime translate against real life machine and data set. To know more, navigate to "performanceAnalysis" directory

<!-- ### Sorting Algorithms
1. Selection Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Radix Sort (using counting sort)

### Searching Algoriths
1. Binary Search
2. Linear Search -->

### Contribution
It is natural that a single person can not know all the tricks that different languages have to offer. Therefore, this repository encourages the ones interested to make contributions. It is appreciated in any way, shape or form! However, plagiarism is not appreciated as it dishonors the very purpose of learning.
